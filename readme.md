## Feature

### Automatic link title feature

> Paste the URL on the editing block

- Existing auto plugins often perform unnecessary conversions and may result in garbled characters. To address this issue, our solution is to confirm with the user through a dialog before making any changes. To use this feature, simply paste the URL and a dialog will appear, allowing you to edit the title if necessary.
